# Web-Application-doctor-s-notebook-
Hello, my name is Oleksandr Shakhov. I'm a junior in fullstack Web Application development.
In this project you can see the Web App for Doctors who can store their Patients and the information about them. 
I created this Application using Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite, jQuery,  Bootstrap and more. 
Also I you can find the promo video of my Web App by clicking on the link below.
