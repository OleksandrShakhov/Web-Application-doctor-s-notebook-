Hello, my name is Oleksandr Shakhov. I'm a beginner in fullstack Web Application development.
In this project you can see the Web App for Doctors who can store their Patients and the information about them using this App. 
I created this Application using Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite, jQuery, Bootstrap and more.
